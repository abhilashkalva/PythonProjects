for the dice roller and made it so you can pick the number of sides on the dice as well as the number of dice you want to roll because I like to challenge myself.
Itâ€™s a fun and simple little project

Creating the function
For this part of the project, I imported 1 library: randint (from random).

from random import randint

Now we are ready to create our dice rolling function. For this function, there will be 2 required inputs: n and x.
n will be the number of sides for the dice you are rolling.
m will be the number of dice you are rolling.

rolls = []
def roll_many(n, m):
    for i in range(m):
        roll = randint(1,n)
        rolls.append(roll)
        print(roll)
        
  Now you can use this function to obtain dice rolls.
# This cell will simulate rolling 4 six-sided dice.
rolls = []
roll_many(6,4)
